.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a small UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ input ]

.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a minimal UNIX shell. It reads commands from the standard input,
parses them into a command name and optional arguments, and executes
either absolute/relative path commands or commands found in the
directories listed in
.BR PATH .

It supports interactive mode (with a prompt) and non\-interactive mode
(reading from pipes/files).

In interactive mode a prompt
.BR "$ "
is displayed and a command line is read using
.BR getline (3).

In non\-interactive mode, commands are read from standard input until
end of file.

A command line always ends with a new line character.

.SH FEATURES
.IP \[bu] 2
Displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command when
running interactively.
.IP \[bu]
Executes commands given as absolute or relative paths
(e.g.
.BR /bin/ls ).
.IP \[bu]
Searches the
.B PATH
environment variable to find commands (e.g.
.BR ls ).
If
.B PATH
is empty or unset, no search is performed.
.IP \[bu]
Handles command lines with arguments.
.IP \[bu]
Handles end of file on standard input (CTRL\-D).
.IP \[bu]
Handles simple error reporting when a command cannot be found.

.SH BUILT\-INS

If
.B exit
is typed with no arguments, the shell terminates and returns the status
of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables, one per line, in the form
.BR NAME=VALUE .

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell exits with the status code of the last executed command.
If a command cannot be executed, a non\-zero status is returned.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
A colon\-separated list of directories searched to find commands
when a command name does not contain a slash.

is empty or unset, only commands given with an absolute or relative
path are executed.
